# Near-Hit Scoring

This repository contains code and data for training and evaluating binary classifiers that predict ligand-binding residues using ESM-derived protein embeddings.

## ðŸ“¥ Input Files

All required input files (e.g., training embeddings, LIGYSIS data) can be downloaded from this shared Google Drive folder:

ðŸ”— [Input Files on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15rIGV7OB60f1sirQV26__LJUbQIM1aW7?hl=cs)

Please download and place them in the appropriate `data/input` directory before running the scripts.


## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `generate_esm_vectors_ligysis.py` â€“ Extracts ESM-2 residue embeddings from protein sequences (LIGYSIS set).
- `train_model.py` â€“ Trains an MLP classifier on scPDB-based datasets and evaluates on LIGYSIS.
- `models/` â€“ Saved PyTorch model checkpoints.
- `data/` â€“ Contains `.parquet` embeddings and prediction outputs.
- `LIGYSIS_predictions.pkl` â€“ Preprocessed LIGYSIS dataset with residue-level annotations.

## Usage

### Generate ESM Vectors
```bash
python generate_esm_vectors_ligysis.py
